Navigation of the Sphero robot through the maze with the help of a drone

The idea of the project is to familiarize with the operation of separate devices as an autonomous system. For the implementation of the mentioned project,
we have at our disposal the programmable robot Sphero SPRK+ and the drone Parrot Bebop 2. As the name of the project dictates, by using Bebop, it is necessary
to add an autonomous component to the Sphero robot that it does not contain by itself, i.e. enable Sphero the robot to move through the maze with Bebop's instructions.
The aircraft hovers over the labyrinth and optimally positions itself above the labyrinth using reference points. The spacecraft's camera constantly records the maze and
the Sphero and tracks its location in relation to reference points. The background controller contains an algorithm that finds the optimal path through the maze and then
sends instructions to the Sphero. Using the image that the controller receives from the spacecraft, it tracks the path that the Sphero has traveled. After the Sphero has
traveled part of the way, the controller sends it a set of instructions: in which direction and at what speed to move until the Sphero executes them. Then the controller
will send a new set of instructions until the Sphero goes through the entire maze.
